### Creation of GitHub Repositry

Used git clone url for the cloning the repository.

I created a repository in github and cloned that in my system.

Then searched for the required folder using cd command.

Then read the required spell file using cat command.

To create a text file i used the coman echo (filename)>>"thenamewegive.txt"

To copy the file to local folder I used cp filename /home/user/location/...

To push the folder to the repository I used git add ., git commit -m "procces name", git push -u -f origin main
