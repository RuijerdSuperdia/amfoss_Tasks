Used git clone url for the cloning the repository
I created a repository in github and cloned that in my sytem
Then searched for the required folder using cd comand
Then read the required spell file using cat comand
To create a text file i used the coman echo (filename)>>"thenamewegive.txt"
To copy the file to local folder I used cp filename /home/user/location/...
To push the folder to the repository I used git add ., git commit -m "procces name", git push -u -f origin main
