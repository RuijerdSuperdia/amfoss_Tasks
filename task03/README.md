### Write up for task03

In this problem we need to print prime numbers up to and including n and print them out to the terminal and the number n must be taken as input from the user. I used a function to define the program. I gave two conditions, first if it is 1 or 0 then it is false, second we iterate in the range 2 to n and check any of it is divisible by the limit, if yes then it is false, else it is true.
