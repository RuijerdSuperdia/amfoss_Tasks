### Explanation for Ethereal Quest

In this problem we need to check if the sum of the elements in the x,y and z axes give 0. I declared three variables s,b and c to store the sum of the x,y and z elements. Then iterated throug the range given by the user. Inside the for loop I declared a empty list. Took input from user in the form of a list and add the elements to the variables declared before. In the end I checked if the sum if equal to 0 or not and returned **YES** or **NO**.
