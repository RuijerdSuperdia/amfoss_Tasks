### Write up for task05

I created two **html** files one for *home page* and the other for *store page*. Also created two **css** files for the html files. At the starting it was very difficult since I didn't have prior knowlege about **html** or **css**. But as I progressed through the task things started getting easier. I used many functions like *span* and *grid* for creating table of contents. Overall it was a easy function.
