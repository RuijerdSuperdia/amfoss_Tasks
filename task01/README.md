### Write up for task01

First I cloned the repositry of task01 in my system. Then created a new directory in the same repository named "codes".

**First Challenge:**

The first *perfect number* is **6**, so it is stored in **06**. The spell is **Spell_05**.

**Second Challenge:**

The first element used to make semiconductors is **Germanium** with atomic number **32**. Hence it is stored in **02** and is **Spell_03**.

**Third Challenge:**

On deciphering the riddle we get **Boggart**. We need to use *git checkout <remote branch><Relative path of the file ot be copied from the other branch> to get the spell. The spell is **Riddikulus**.

**Fourth Challenge:**

We need to find the spell from the commit logs. The spell is **Priori Incantatem**.

The final code:**aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs**

We need to use: *echo aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs | base64 --decode* to decode it.

we get:https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell
